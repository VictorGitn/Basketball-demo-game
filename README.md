# Basketball-demo-game
 My simple microgame. Where You can throw the ball by pressing the space button. By adjusting the force and angle of the throw with the sliders, you can aim at the ring. If you throw the ball into the ring, you will get points and change the position for the throw. To quickly return the ball to your hands, you can press Space.
